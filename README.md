# Noise monitor that use in parties
Nowadays, many people share rooms or live in apartments with many people. If they hold parties, it would be very easy to interup their neighbors since they don't know the sound level they make. Therefore, I decide to make a noise monitor for parties to give people reminder and build a peaceful living environment for people. The device is designed just for parties and if people are too load it would give reminder.

#Sensor Sketch and Picture
I want to use** SparkFun Sound Detector **to detect the sound level. Put this sensor in the device and guide the gauge to show sound level. If the level over the setting value, turn on the LED to give people a reminder.

#Display Sketch
Put the device on the room that holds parties to monitor the environment sound level. If the noise too load, the LED will turn on and give reminder to people they might interup their neibours. Also, people can see the current sound level by watching the guage needle on the device.
