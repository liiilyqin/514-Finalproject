# Noise monitor that use in parties
Nowadays, many people share rooms or live in apartments with many people. If they hold parties, it would be very easy to interup their neighbors since they don't know the sound level they make. Therefore, I decide to make a noise monitor for parties to give people reminder and build a peaceful living environment for people. The device is designed just for parties and if people are too load it would give reminder.
